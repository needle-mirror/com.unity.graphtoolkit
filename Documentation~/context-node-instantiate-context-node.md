# Instantiate context nodes in your graph

This procedure assumes you have already implemented a context node in your graph tool, as described in [Implement a context node](context-node-implement-context-node.md).

To add a context node:

1. Right-click on the graph canvas and select `Create node...` to open the graph item library window.
1. Navigate to the **Contexts** category.
1. Double-click to add your desired context node to your graph.

The added context node behaves like any other node in the graph.
You can move it, disable it, remove it, or connect it to other nodes or variables.

A new context node doesn't contain any blocks. The user needs to add these afterward.

Follow the steps in [Instantiate and manage block nodes](context-node-instantiate-manage-block-node.md) to add blocks to your context node.
