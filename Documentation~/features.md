[!INCLUDE [Experimental Warning message](experimental-release.md)]

The following table provides access to detailed documentation about each feature area in Graph Toolkit:

| Feature area                                             | Description |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| [Node](node-landing.md)                                  | Fundamental building blocks of a graph that represent specific operations or pieces of logic. |
| [Context node](context-node-landing.md)                  | Specialized nodes that serve as dynamic containers for compatible block nodes. |
| [Port](port-features.md)*                                | Connection points on nodes that can be linked with wires to establish relationships. |
| [Wire](wire-features.md)*                                | Lines that create connections between node ports. |
| [Blackboard](blackboard-features.md)*                    | Panel that displays and manages variables available for use in the graph. |
| [Variable](variable-features.md)*                        | Data containers with names, types, and values accessible throughout a graph. |
| [Graph inspector](graph-inspector-features.md)*          | Panel that provides detailed information about selected graph elements. |
| [Minimap](minimap-features.md)*                          | Small overview of the entire graph for navigation and visualization. |
| [Toolbar](toolbar-features.md)*                          | Customizable panels providing direct access to common actions through button controls. |
| [Graph item library](graph-item-library-features.md)*    | Catalog of nodes that can be added to the current graph. |
| [Subgraph](subgraph-features.md)*                        | Graphs nested within other graphs for organization and reusability of logic. |
| [Portal](portal-features.md)*                            | Connection points that work in pairs and replace visible wires with wireless pathways. |
| [Sticky note](sticky-note-features.md)*                  | Visual elements for adding comments or annotations to graphs. |
| [Placemat](placemat-features.md)*                        | Visual background elements for grouping related graph elements. |
| [Alignment](alignment-features.md)*                      | Tools for precise positioning and arrangement of graph elements. |
| [Selection](selection-features.md)*                      | Methods for choosing and manipulating individual or multiple graph elements. |
| [Deletion](deletion-features.md)*                        | Methods for removing elements from graphs. |
| [Pan and zoom](pan-zoom-features.md)*                    | Controls for adjusting view and navigation within the graph canvas. |
| [Hotkey](hotkey-features.md)*                            | Keyboard shortcuts for efficient execution of common editing operations. |
| [Missing item](missing-item-features.md)*                | Visual indicators for broken graph elements and connections. |
| [Error](error-features.md)*                              | Systems for displaying warnings, errors, and messages within graphs. |
| [Display optimization](display-optimization-features.md)* | Rendering techniques for maintaining performance with complex graphs. |
| [Graph processing](graph-processing-features.md)*        | Hooks for analyzing graphs and responding to structural changes. |
