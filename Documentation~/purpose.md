Graph Toolkit provides a comprehensive [framework](glossary.md#framework) for developing node-based tools within the Unity Editor. It enables you to create your own graph tool with custom nodes while providing all the UI components for adding, connecting, and manipulating these nodes on a canvas. This allows you to focus on implementing domain-specific functionality rather than handling UI concerns.
