    /// <remarks>
    /// Apply this attribute to a custom <see cref="Graph"/> class to declare it as a valid subgraph type for a specific parent (main) graph type.
    /// This attribute is required when you want to designate a specific graph type to function as a subgraph in tools that support subgraphs.
    /// <br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// Use it on custom graph classes that are designed to act as subgraphs.
    /// This is useful when you want to provide specialized subgraph behaviors, customize the user experience, or restrict subgraph usage
    /// to certain graph types.
    /// <br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// When a graph type declares that it supports subgraphs using <see cref="GraphOptions.SupportsSubgraphs"/>
    /// but no corresponding <see cref="SubgraphAttribute"/> is found, the main graph type itself is used as the subgraph type by default.
    /// <br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// You can associate multiple subgraph types with the same main graph type. In this case, the editor's context menu includes multiple
    /// "Create <c>Subgraph class name</c> Subgraph from Selection" actionsâ€”one for each valid subgraph type.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <example>
    /// <code>
    /// // This declares a subgraph type used by MyMainGraph
    /// [Subgraph(typeof(MyMainGraph))]
    /// public class MySubgraph : Graph
