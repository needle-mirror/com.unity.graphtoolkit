# Graph Toolkit

This package provides a framework to build graph editing tools
including a graph data model, a UI foundation and graph-to-asset pipeline.

Graph Toolkit provides a set of API to help you develop
graph editing tools. As such, it has no functionality immediately
available to the user; however, if you write a tool that deals with
graphs, Graph Toolkit can help you reach your goals more
quickly while adhering to a set of Unity UI and UX standards.

This package is available as an experimental package, so it's not ready for 
production use. The features and documentation in this package might 
change before it's verified for release. 

## Installation

To install this package, follow the instructions for [adding a package by name](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-quick.html) in the Unity Editor.
